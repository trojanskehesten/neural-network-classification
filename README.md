# Neural Network Classification
Classification objects on the aerial photos using neural networks  
Scheme of neural network please look at the file "Description.png".  
  
There are 2 models:  
  1. softmax model with 1 layer (Easy_NN.py)  
  2. convolutional neural network with 9 layers (Convolutional_NN.py).  
  
Dataset for training was created by me using aerial orthophoto from unmanned aerial vehicle of [Mavinci GmbH](ftp://mavinci.de). It is consist of 3384 aerial images of 3 objects (trees, grassland and roads).
The dataset is possible to download [here](https://yadi.sk/d/7Q5tMVM83YwSw7).  
  
The training is very hard for calculation. For the task please use powerfull computer or [google cloud](https://cloud.google.com/).
